<h1>Present-tense. An unlikely (non) Buddhist take on the Death of a Parent.</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        My Mother is dying, present-tense.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have many thoughts about that — as a son, a buddhist and man. If only to assuage my feelings of grief a bit
        and to avoid relying too much on others, I have been writing them down, since June. There is no avoiding death
        or loneliness any longer, although I believe part of me very much, and quite reasonably wants to.
    </p>
    <p>
        On Memorial Day weekend, my mother choked on hot-dog, and her heart stopped. I find it painfully ironic that the
        last solid food my American-Italian Mother ate was a hot-dog. My father could not resuscitate her and she
        slipped into a coma. I didn’t know about the incident until the next day when my brother called. We already knew
        that she was suffering from dementia or something akin to it — hence the swallowing issues. When she came out of
        the coma, she received another diagnosis — stomach cancer. I went to bed, for about three days. My brother would
        call and tell me what was going on, but most people I spoke with didn’t really know what to say — if anything at
        all. This was the first time I noticed very few people know how to deal with death, or can appreciate another
        person’s experience. There was also an awkwardness around tearfulness, weakness and vulnerability — I’m a “man”
        after all. “Get out of bed,” said the man inside the man.
    </p>
    <p>
        When my Mother renamed one of the orderlies who looked after her in the IC, “Leonardo,” I was reading Walter
        Isaacson’s new biography of Leonardo Da Vinci. Does this mean anything? Is it because scientists have discovered
        there is a little bit of me left in my Mum? I suppose I could choose to ignore these odd things, and say that
        these are just mere coincidences — but they are not.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tibetan Buddhist yogis tell us that at the time of death, many doors open to knowledge and other worlds — these
        are temporary, mental places we visit before rebirth called bardos. Our ability to correctly navigate the bardo
        of death is based on our familiarity with the deep recesses of the primordial mind — most especially, how we
        experience pain, suffering and loss. From a calm base, connections and new karma can arise, lessons can be
        absorbed, the voice can be heard. What or whom we see as a monster wielding an axe to chop off our head
        transforms into a lotus-bearing goddess. If a being experiences a good, conscious death, then everyone around
        them is affected by it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Death can be and often is a tremendously important teaching. In the Zen tradition I have my formal practice
        training in — we refer to this as the “great conversation.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the past year, I have been meditating more than ever. I am also finishing an elaborate, half-body tattoo. I
        have had plenty of time to meditate on pain, suffering and loss. Not coincidentally, the main subject of my back
        piece is the Bodhisattva <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kṣitigarbha"><em>Kstsigharba</em></a>, the
        protector of children, women, and guide to the deceased between lives.
    </p>

    <p>
        I rarely talk about, never mind openly display my tattoos, but recently, a brave soul passing by me while I was
        working out asked, “Why would you do all that to your body?” It’s a legitimate question and one I’d been turning
        over in my mind ever since I started. I don’t know why anyone else is doing this, that’s none of my business.
        Let me dismiss a myth. Tattooing a significant portion of your human body takes too much effort, time, and money
        for it to be reduced to “Oh, this looks badass.” The process of Japanese tattooing is long and often
        extraordinarily painful. Of course, it is also entirely deliberate, and self-inflicted. I choose. Basic buddhism
        teaches us that we shape our minds through our choices. No one is up there or out there is influencing me.
        Everything is a choice, either subconscious or conscious.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <em>
            Everything is mind, since the physical brain is the font of the mind, everything, too, is the body.
        </em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I choose this pain because I believe that what I can endure gracefully and consciously creates the unique sense
        of reality we experience; nothing is left out, and everything is valuable. I am creating a skillful
        reorientation to my relationship to trauma, pain, and death. A calibration of the soul that in no small
        way — prepares me to enter into the second act of my life as I approach fifty. My tattooing experience, my grief
        about my Mother’s imminent passing are bardos as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        What once I felt I had no power over is now being contemplated each second — every tinge of pain, every prick of
        the needle, every drop of blood, each hour of healing. Time on the tattoo table really isn’t any different from
        time on the zafu. I’m dealing with my body and my brain as I pass through a tiny bardo of people chattering,
        needles whirring, loud music, and of course my skin being inserted with ink. We can and do choose pain…the real
        question is first, what is the real pain in our lives — and second, do we wish to experience pain in a way that
        creates beauty and power or do we let pain overwhelm us? When I sit down on my meditation cushion, I zoom in on
        what hurts — what feels like crap. I follow the breath and ask — what is this?
    </p>
    <p>
        When my Mother was given six months to live, I knew that the entire process was going to deepen everything — and
        it has. I zoomed in on it. I am more prepared for this than I may have thought — and still, as you will read in
        a moment, I made mistakes. Mostly, if not entirely, because I reached outside of my own experience for
        understanding. Many readers will decry this statement — of course we need others! I happen to agree with you,
        but that was not the lesson this time.
    </p>
    <p>
        My Mum has progressive super-nuclear palsy, a degenerative disorder affecting the brain, and stomach cancer. The
        found the latter because of the former causes problems in swallowing, speech and aspiration. She will most
        certainly leave this life in the next few months. There is nothing special about her illness, except that she is
        my Mother, and it will be her las illness.
    </p>
    <p>
        My family is made up of three older siblings and my Dad. We are all, naturally in shock, often contentious, and
        not doing so well. Inevitably everything that was dysfunctional to begin with is now even more so — that
        includes my own behavior. I have not handled certain moments well. I blew up my ex’s phone thinking she could
        help me, that she <em>should</em> talk to me— when I knew from experience with her that this was definitely not
        a good idea.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <em>Lesson: Expect that absolute utter worst during a time of death. It is not “pretty” or sterilized or
            gentle.</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        A parent’s demise is a powerful bardo — an opening to huge lessons. The most important amongst them is
        forgiveness. As a family, we have long been estranged from one another. I am not sure we will grow any closer
        now — but I would like to think we can create some peace. Unfortunately, that is not unfolding, and that too, is
        a lesson. We cannot change people.
    </p>
    <p>
        My mother is eighty, she is frail, hungry, cannot swallow or speak terribly well and just got over pneumonia. We
        did not think she should have radiation treatments for fear of them making her condition worse — and of course,
        she decided she wants them because she’d have to get better to die.When I told my therapist — (who is
        fortunately a fellow practitioner) about my mother, he sighed and said, “Well, sounds like you are entering into
        another period of mourning.”</p>
    <p>Oh joy, I thought, as a Basho poem came to mind.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <em>
            The temple bell stops — 
            <br>
            but the sound keeps coming
            <br>
            out of the flowers.
            <br>
            The contrail dissipates — 
            <br>
            but the sound keeps coming
            <br>
            out of the sky.
            <br>
        </em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        My therapist was referring to the fact that I broke things off with my partner after four years of an on-again,
        off-again tumultuous relationship in January-after nearly a year of being entirely disenchanted with one
        another. I had gone to see him specifically to get out of the relationship where I felt demeaned and trapped.
        Here we are in October, and my Mother is dying. My ex is not newly allergic to the notion of the other. She
        believes in utter, complete emotional autonomy — which is admirable, but she tends to be blisteringly and
        unnecessarily harsh about it. As is often the case in this sort of dynamic that arises from dating someone who
        is, (ahem) “empowered” in this unique way, when the shit hits the fan, the other chooses to morph into an
        anxious, codependent needful of attention. Surprise! It’s the same pitiable role that I played in my family
        dynamic. Mind you — I chose that role and have played it extremely well for a long time. I might regret it, but
        I’m not going to deny it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Relationships grow or wither in the light and heat of grief, loss, and pain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some cannot withstand the reality of human imperfection. When we did reconnect briefly in June, I was beside
        myself. I didn’t have any more energy to listen to her blather about office politics, hating the twats in her
        yoga class or how well she was day-trading. I did not want to drop what I was doing and help her move. “My
        mother is dying, I’m not exactly tip-top”…did not seem to make a dent. To her credit, she made it abundantly
        clear that she was not going to show up, even as a friend, and that I was on my own. Further, she reminded me
        later, I ought not to have had any “bullshit expectations” (her exact words) to begin with.
    </p>
    <p>
        Verbal abuse like this from someone whom you love is not ideal, but it is real. I know her boundaries. The point
        is that when we are in crises of this nature — we find out very quickly what people are truly made of. We find
        out just how needy we really are, and just how much another person can stomach. We should become aware of our
        entitlement and our pain because no one has to do anything for anyone anymore these days — that is partially the
        increasing selfish, self-centered culture we live in with a large dose of human nature mixed in. That is also
        the affect of ten thousand years of male oppression. Women had to drop everything and give a shit. Now women are
        allowed to not give a shit. They do not have to care. Nor should they be expected to care. That is an expression
        of pent-up autonomy. You can thank #metoo, for that too. Good or bad, right or wrong, this transition cannot be
        ignored. Men have to grow up.
    </p>
    <p>
        I accept that this is the way things are now. Some people are going to be callous in enforcing their boundaries.
        Especially women whom are expected always to be open and receptive. Perceiving someone like this as “bad” isn’t
        helpful — it’s just how they choose to be — and it must be effective for them. My therapist once said to me that
        the best place to start when others disappoint us is from the perspective that they likely have a damn good
        reason for doing whatever it is they are doing. Think about that one.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <em>
            Lesson: Accept, do not blame those who do not have the inclination, time, consideration or empathy to deal
            with you. There is nothing wrong with them — and there is nothing wrong with you hurting and needing either.
            Everyone has got something going on that prohibits them from being fully present to another human being
        </em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I reached out to this person, (who to her credit has no shortage of experience with pain) twice for support. Two
        times I made the absolute worst decision and things for me became far worse than they had been without her. I’m
        sure she wasn’t thrilled with the exchanges either. When I said, “ Yes, my behavior is out of sorts, yes I’m
        being needy right now.” She said, “You are acting like a loser”. When I said, “Yes of course, I’m fucked up
        right now, I’m sorry, but my Mother is dying,” her response was, <em>“Your mother has been dying for twenty
        years and more so in the last six months, boo-hoo-hoo.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        These are not compassionate words. These are the gnarly edges of hard-core boundaries. My persistence drove her
        farther away. Yes, there are more skillful and kind ways to enforce them — but no one can save you, no one can
        make anything hurt less, no one can do anything for you. That is buddhism. That is the meaning of the
        paranirvana sutta. Save yourself. Light your own lamp. Don’t look to anyone or anything to staunch the pain. I
        feel thankful to this person for showing me this, but more thankful to whatever is in me that is finally
        agreeing to listen.
    </p>

    <p>
        My first goal, of course, is to remain in my body and avoid drinking myself into the gutter, my second goal is,
        of course, to understand. Slowing down to mourn the loss of another human being, never mind one’s own Mother is
        about as antithetical to the bloody rush of modern “reality” as possible. And that is where I’d like to
        be — vested in a true hope for my Mother that she has the right exit — and that is all I wish. My concern for me
        is that I remain present for the experience.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <em>

    <p>
        Watching one’s mother die turns the volume down on bullshit. I’m not happy right now — and I have no issue with
        that. I am, however, feeling, showing up for work, not drinking myself into a stupor, working out every day and
        generally sane. I also have zero patience for turning what is going on into an excuse to analyze the shit out of
        it. I can <em>feel</em> what is going on — and that’s all I need to know.
    </p>
    <p>
        I practice non-buddhist Buddhism, or zen. I like to call it “Buddhism with a little b.” One of the most poignant
        memories I have of studying Buddhism was when I was introduced to the mustard seed parable. The mustard seed
        revolves around a woman named <em>Kisa Gotami</em> whose young son died.
    </p>
    <p>
        The story goes that Kisa hauled the corpse of her son along with her, and pleaded with the Buddha to bring him
        back to life. The Buddha paused for a while before instructing Kisa to go back to her village and gather mustard
        seeds, but only from the households of those who have never been touched by the death. From those mustard seeds,
        he promised Kisa, he would create a medicine to bring her son back to life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kisa went back to her village and began asking her neighbors for mustard seeds with the one condition that they
        had never experienced death in their home.
    </p>
    <p>
        As one might expect, all of her neighbors were willing to give her mustard seeds, but they all told her that all
        of them had been touched by death one time or another. “The living are few, but the dead are many, ” her wise
        friends incanted.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the moon came up, the sad mother was still without any of the mustard seeds that she had been instructed to
        collect, but she realized the teaching of impermanence as quickly as she opened herself up to the notion that
        Kisa really wasn’t alone at all as she wept.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <em>
            <b>“It’s not just a truth for one village or town, Nor is it a truth for a single family. But for every
                world settled by gods [and men], This indeed is what is true — impermanence” (Olendzki, 2010).</b>
        </em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        With this new understanding, Kisa buried her son in the forest and then returned to Buddha. She confessed to him
        that she could not obtain any of the mustard seeds he had instructed her to collect because she could not find
        even one single house untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Buddha taught Kisa not just that everyone has known death in their family, in their life, but that
        everything in this life is impermanent.
        I remind those who ask me for my opinion on philosophical matters like life and death-that the perennial
        questions themselves have changed. We do not live in small villages, nor practice the same religion. We do not
        honor death. We barely discuss the end of a loved one. Today, some even say there will be a cure for death
        brought to us by artificial intelligence. In other words, whatever concept of immateriality and impermanence
        that existed in the 5th century BCE is different than how you or I might consider it.
    </p>
    <p>
        My well-meaning friends are bewildered when I tell them my mother is dying. They skip over it in a few
        sentences. They ask the obvious question, the one I am asking myself — when will you visit her?
    </p>
    <p>
        To be sure, I have deliberated that for nearly three months
    </p>
    <p>
        First, I have not had any semblance of a real relationship with my mother in a very long time. That was by
        choice — a poor one at that. I saw my Mother in the summer of 2011, but not since. She was sitting in an upright
        beach-chair next to my Father momentarily, both of them gripping a tumbler filled with vodka as if they had the
        habit to do — for nearly forty years. There was very little to talk about — and quickly, automatically I tried
        to save the situation by cracking jokes, making things up, getting them to laugh. But it didn’t work. I was not
        drinking, and the invitation to enjoy “shrimp cocktail by the pool” extended by my older brother hadn’t
        materialized. He was inside on his phone, talking to a client.
    </p>
    <p>
        Later on, as they took their positions in front of the television, I got up, wished them the best and walked out
        the door to car service waiting in the driveway.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have not seen them since. In the summer of 2014, I was living in a village in Italy finishing my first novel.
        I wrote my parents a nasty email. I explained how I felt that my childhood was stupendously shitty and all the
        ways they had fucked up. Four years later, I regret that. I chose to channel regret and my own lack of healing
        at people not equipped to do anything about it, or even process the information. My actions were stupid and
        selfish. Again, I was looking for someone else to assuage what is going on with me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I decided I didn’t want any more of that awkward evening on our patio, nor the feud between my sisters, the
        awkward conversations with my older brother with whom I have very little in common — (with whom now I have an
        excellent relationship). Nor the problematic halting discussions with my Mother whose dementia was slowly
        settling in like June fog over the Golden Gate bridge — devoid of any original beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is nothing romantic about seeing a parent’s light fade out. There is a lot of ugliness in all of this — a
        lot of tubes, and machines and smells and memories that I did not want to dredge up like the clams I dug with my
        uncles years ago on the beach. Foremost amongst all this is the simple fact that the primary dynamic of my
        family has and always will be one of dysfunction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Contrary to Dr. Phil and every other charlatan making millions off the woes of others — most broken families
        stay broken. Even when apologies are uttered and wounds given a goodly balm of therapy and time — things are
        left as they were found, in a painful void. The squeaky wheel, whatever it might be, alcohol, abuse, mental
        illness, tends to go right on squeaking for the unfortunate families that cannot muster cooperation amongst
        themselves or from support groups or therapists.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oddly enough, a sort of calm has descended.
    </p>
    <p>
        The equanimity signals an acceptance of my powerlessness in the face of everything that is unfolding. Assurance
        comes from inwardly knowing that at this stage of my life, at this stage of my own evolution, — pain, death, and
        mourning do not need to “spin me out.” That does not mean that I am ignoring them — quite to the contrary, I
        feel every needle prick, every sound.
    </p>

        <em>
            <b>“The same wind that picks up the leaf on one side of the mountain moves the clouds over the valley.”</b>
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        I accept the inevitability of my Mother’s death by admitting that I am most certainly going to be in pain about
        it now, present tense and for the foreseeable future. Instead of desperately reaching out, I go in, instead of
        running, I prepare. Instead of numbing, I wake up. Instead of bracing for impact, I let go of the body like I
        once did as a surfer — entangled in a foamy wipe-out, I let go, I let go…
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>I let go.</em>
